### Context

# الاعجاز العددي في القرآن و جساب الجمل
# The Miracle of Quran and Alphabet Numerals
Allah Said: (4:82) Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? If it had been from [any] other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction
قال تعالى > أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ ۚ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ اللَّهِ لَوَجَدُوا فِيهِ اخْتِلَافًا كَثِيرًا 82> سورة النساء

For the last twenty years or more, different scholars, such as Abderrazzaq Nufal, Bassám Jarrar, Abdu A-Daim Kuhail, among others, have studied the miracle of numbers of the Holy Quran. The truth is that the use of computers and statistics programs have made this task much easier, leading to the acknowledgment of the miracle of numbers in the Quran. These results speak for themselves, the numbers don't lie, and show the divine origin of this Sacred Text

I hope you use this dataset to dig deeper and find your way to yet another astonishing number miracle of The Quran.
